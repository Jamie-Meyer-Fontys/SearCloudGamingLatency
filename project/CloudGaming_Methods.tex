\section{Methods}
This is the methods section written in the methods.tex file!We used Google's form app to create our own survey with questions about cloud gaming and personal gaming information. The survey we designed was completely anonymous. The personal questions were about what kind of system(s) the interviewee mainly used for video games, what kind of network was used, and what kind of video games the interviewee mainly played (single player, online multiplayer, co-op). Whereas the questions about cloud gaming focused more on what the interviewee thinks about cloud gaming, whether they were familiar with it, status of their internet connection and if they are interested in it.

The audience we chose to fill out this survey were the students of Software Engineering and Business Informatics Fontys Venlo. Furthermore, we sent the survey to some social media groups that we were connected to.
