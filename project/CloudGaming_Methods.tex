\section{Methods}
This section contains all the methods that embodied the methodology of our research to answer our question.

\subsection{Survey on (cloud) gaming}
We thought that public opinions could be useful for this research, because most of the cloud gaming services are targeted to the respondents (male/female, 16-30) in our survey, so that's why we decided to create a survey with questions about cloud gaming and personal gaming information. The survey we designed was completely anonymous. The survey was divided in two parts: The first part focused on questions that were related to gaming from the perspective of the interviewee, where the second part focused on questions about cloud gaming and their opinion about its features, subscriptions and requirements.
\\\\
The audience we chose to fill in the survey were the students of Software Engineering and Business Informatics from Fontys Venlo. Furthermore, we sent the survey to some social media groups that we were connected to. The entire survey was built in Google Forms, an application tool developed by Google to create an online survey with ease. To get closer to our research question, we had to think of questions related to our topic. 
Questions such as what type of network, video games and system(s) the interviewee is related to were useful to us. There were also questions about network latency and whether it happened often at home. Finally, we also added questions to the survey to see if the interviewee is familiar with cloud gaming, if they know of certain services and what opinions they have about cloud gaming. When the survey is fully answered Google auto-generates graphs based on the answers, we didn't use this because we wanted to export and import the data to RStudio to analyse and visualize the data ourselves.

\subsection{Our survey questions explained}
We took 6 questions from our survey that we found the most useful to visualise and explain.
\begin{itemize}
	\item What type of network do you use for playing games?
	\\Whe chose this question to collect information on the type of network where the respondents play games on. And to find out which one is the most popular.
	\item Do you have a strong internet connection?
	\\Whe chose this question to continue with the trend of the previous question, as being more specific to network strength.
	\item When you play an online game, do you often have latency issues?
	\\Whe chose this question again to continue the trend of the first question, but more specific to online gaming and if there are already any known issues with the respondents network.
	\item How interested are you in cloud gaming?
	\\Whe chose this question to scope the general interest of cloud gaming in our group of respondents. The answers range from not interested to highly interested.
	\item Do you think cloud gaming has a future?
	\\Whe chose this question to collect the general thought of the respondents about cloud gaming, if it has potential to be used wide-spread.
	\item How likely are you going to give cloud gaming a try?
	\\Whe chose this question to group the amount of interest in cloud gaming from the respondents, which range from not likely to highly likely.
