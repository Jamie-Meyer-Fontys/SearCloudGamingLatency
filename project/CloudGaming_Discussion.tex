\subsection{What we can improve}
Many questions in our survey contained checkboxes where you could make more than one choice, most of the data became attributes with multiple values, which made it very difficult to visualize the data. Something else that was not very smart to include in our survey was the option to leave an open answer, which also led to difficult visualization. For the next survey we may create, we will leave out the open-answer option and make more use of closed questions or multiple-choice answers (one answer possible), to avoid attributes with multiple values and difficult visualisations.
