\section{Introduction}

\subsection{What is a cloud gaming service?}
Cloud gaming is a method of playing video games using a remote servers which essentially run the video game and stream the game play to your local device.
This local device can be any device which the cloud gaming service supports,
this can differ from provider to provider but most support all relevant platforms: mobile, desktop, console and the web.\\\\ 
The amount of freedom you get with a specific cloud gaming service also differs from provider to provider some services only allow you to play games that are available in their catalog, while others pretty much give you remote access to a full on high end gaming computer where you can play and do anything on. Some providers also give additional benefits such as free games and a free controller whenever you sign up for their service.\\\\
Cloud gaming does require the user to have a good and stable internet connection for a good experience but since internet speeds are getting faster and more accessible to larger groups of people cloud gaming will become a more competitive option for people to choose from, especially with current shortages in computer hardware and increased prices in video game consoles. 

\subsection{How do we define latency in this context?}
Latency in this research is defined as the time it takes for the client to pass a data packet from their place to another \parencite{cloudfare}. Latency can be determined by many possible factors, such as: Internet connection speed, the distance between the client and host, traffic loads, servers that are overloaded \parencite{thg}, the connection between the client's console and router, router settings not optimized for gaming, low memory space or old system hardware \parencite{ulmer} \parencite{weak}.\\\\
Whether the client is using a wired or a wireless network, both types share latency, but the difference is noticeable. While a normal wired network doesn't quite travel at the speed of light, the latency is almost imperceptible to humans, being a 12-34 ms delay (fiber or cable internet). When a wireless network is being used by the client, the latency depends on the type of GHz that is being used, which in this case is 2.4 and 5 GHz. Where 2.4 GHz can be used in a large covered area having wall penetration, the low data rate is one of the key points where latency can occur. And while 5 GHz has a smaller covered area with no wall penetration, it uses orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) which creates a high data rate that keeps latency lower than what a 2.4 GHz network type can create \parencite{century} \parencite{netgear}.\\\\
Latency can be an annoyance, to some extend. For people who don't normally play video games or online games and use their network (mostly) for social media, Internet searches, or messaging services, it's usually not a big problem. But for the people who do use their network to play online video games, it is disruptive. In an online video game, it is convenient (or even mandatory) for the person to play without internet interference, to perform the right actions at the right time. But when the latency in their game is high, the player is often stuck on the frame where he/she was a few seconds ago and has (almost) no flexibility in their game. This is only for games that require an internet connection, where games that doesn't need one can run smoothly without latency issues (depending on your hardware).\\\\
So what about cloud gaming, a game that doesn't require an internet connection to play just runs without problems right? Unfortunately the problems are exactly the same as with an online game that is not attached to cloud gaming. Even if you play an offline game via cloud gaming, it still means that you can experience input latency. For example, where the player presses a button that is seen as a jump function, it might take more than 1-2 seconds for the input to be received by the host and send back to the player, which can make the gameplay very difficult.
\subsection{Popular cloud gaming services}
While cloud gaming would not be the first option for most video game players, mainly because most already have a home console or gaming computer in their homes or maybe because the internet connection is not always good, some companies have managed to make cloud gaming usable for the customer. Cloud gaming services such as Shadow, GeForce Now and Google Stadia have been well received by customers in the year 2021.\\\\
\textbf{Shadow}\\
\citetitle{shadow} is a cloud gaming service that is available for Windows, Mac, smartphone, tablet and for the television. The service requires a strong internet connection with 15 Mbps at the minimum for the best performance.\\\\
Shadow gives the customer a high-end gaming computer for Windows 10 that is stored in their data center, which can be accessed anywhere. The computer is primarily made for the purpose to play video games that requires expensive hardware, but that's not all the computer has to offer. It can also be used for homework, video/sound editing, 3D rendering, and using other streaming services (Netflix, Hulu, etc.), which serves as an alternative to your personal computer.\\\\
\textbf{GeForce NOW}\\
\citetitle{now} is the cloud gaming service from NVIDIA, it is available for desktop, smartphones, the web and television. The service requires 15 Mbps for 720p 60fps, 25 Mbps for 1080p 60fps and 35 Mbps for 1440p game play streaming. NVIDIA also recommends to have a maximum of 80 ms of latency from an NVIDIA data center, but less than 40 ms is recommended for the best experience.\\\\
GeForce NOW has 3 subscription tiers, these tiers are called the "FREE", "PRIORITY" and the "RTX 3080" tiers. with the free tier you get a basic gaming computer without RTX capabilities and your screen time is limited to 1 hour per gaming session. after the session is done you have to re-enter the queue to gain another session. With the priority tier you gain priority in the queue, you screen time is increased to 6 hours and you get an RTX capable computer. And with The RTX 3080 tier you get access to the highest end computers and your screen time is increased to 8 hours.
Even though GeForce NOW doesn't give your complete access to a full desktop environment the service gets praised for its large game library and variety.\\\\
\textbf{Google Stadia}\\
Google's cloud gaming service, called \citetitle{stadia}, is a service that allows customers to stream video games through their desktop, laptop, smartphone or tablet immediately without queuing. The television is also an option for streaming, where you can use the Chromecast Ultra and Stadia controller to play video games. It is recommended to have an internet connection with a speed of 10 Mbps.\\\\
Stadia offers a 1 month free trial of Stadia Pro, which gives the customer access to an endlessly growing library of games playable with no additional costs. Every game you save to your Stadia Pro subscription, you keep it for as long as you stay within your subscription. If you don't want Stadia Pro, you can also buy the games from Stadia separately.\\\\
