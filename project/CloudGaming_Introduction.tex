\subsection{How do we define latency in this context?}
Latency in this research is defined as the time that it takes for the client to pass data/input, or a data packet from their place to another. Latency can be affected or determined by many possible factors, such as: Internet connection speed, the distance between the client and host, internet traffic, servers that are overloaded, the connection between the client's console and router, router settings not optimized for gaming, low memory space or old system hardware.\\\\
Whether the client is using a wired or a wireless network, both types share latency, however, the difference is noticeable. While a normal wired network doesn't quite travel at the speed of light, the latency is almost imperceptible to humans, being a 12-34 ms delay (depending on whether it's fiber or cable internet). When a wireless network is being used by the client, the latency is depended on the type of GHz that is being used, which in this case is 2.4 and 5 GHz. Where 2.4 GHz can be used in a large covered area and having wall penetration, the low data rate is one of the key points where latency can occur. And while 5 GHz has a smaller covered area where you can use it with no wall penetration, it uses Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) which creates a high data rate that keeps latency lower than what a 2.4 GHz network type can create.\\\\
In general, latency is a bad thing, to some extend. For people who don't normally play video games or online games and use their network (mostly) for social media, Internet searches, or messaging services, it's usually not a big problem. But for the people who do use their network to play video games (and especially games that require an Internet connection), it is disruptive. In an online video game, it is convenient (or even mandatory) for the player to play without internet interference, to perform the right actions at the right time multiple times. But when the latency in an online game is high, the player is often stuck on the frame where he/she was a few seconds ago and has (almost) no flexibility in their game.
